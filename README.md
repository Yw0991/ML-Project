Predicting Mammalian Sleep Durations Using Regression Models

Overview

The Sleep Regression Analysis project utilizes machine learning to predict "TotalSleep" and "Dreaming" durations for animals, based on diverse attributes. It aims to reveal how different factors influence sleep, using regression models to provide valuable insights for sleep research and applications.

Dataset & Libraries

Dataset: The "sleep_dataset.xlsx" dataset encompasses general, ecological, and biological attributes of mammals, focusing on "TotalSleep" and "Dreaming" durations. It's aimed at analyzing how these factors influence sleep patterns across species.

Libraries:

Numpy & Pandas: For numerical computations and data manipulation.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: For visualizing data through graphs and heatmaps.
Scikit-learn: For data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
Results Overview

Our models predict "TotalSleep" and "Dreaming" with notable accuracy, utilizing Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) for evaluation. Key outcomes include:

Total Sleep: MAPE of 0.362 and RMSE of 3.653. Dreaming: MAPE of 0.473 and RMSE of 0.789.

These results highlight the impact of various animal attributes on sleep, showcasing the potential of machine learning in understanding sleep behaviors.
